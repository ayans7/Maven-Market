# Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard for Maven Market

# Project Overview: 
Maven Market, a multinational grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, faced challenges in tracking and analyzing their sales performance across different regions, product categories, and time periods. To address this, I developed a dynamic, interactive sales performance dashboard using Power BI, enabling the sales and management teams to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

# Objectives:
1.	Data Transformation and Cleaning: Transform raw sales data into structured, actionable insights by connecting and shaping the data from various sources.
2.	Building a Relational Model: Design an optimized relational data model to support dynamic reporting.
3.	Interactive Reporting: Develop an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard to visualize sales data.
4.	Real-time Updates: Enable real-time updates, ensuring that the sales team has access to the most current information for decision-making.
5.	Actionable Insights: Provide insights into key sales metrics, trends, and customer behavior, enabling data-driven strategies to optimize sales performance.

# Key Features and Benefits:

1.	Regional Performance Comparison:
  i.	The dashboard enables the sales team to compare performance across different regions (Canada, Mexico, US) by visualizing metrics like total sales, units sold, and growth over time.
  ii.	Regional leaders can drill down into specific locations to understand which stores or areas are performing well and which need attention.

2.	Product Category Trends:
  i.	Interactive visuals allow users to explore product category performance in detail. The dashboard provides insights into top-performing categories, seasonal trends, and variations 
      in demand over time.
  ii.	Identifies underperforming categories, enabling better stock management and product focus.

3.	High-Value Customers Identification:
  i.	With calculated fields and customer segmentation, the dashboard highlights high-value customers based on purchase behavior, frequency, and total spend.
  ii.	Helps the sales and marketing teams target promotions and loyalty programs more effectively.

4.	Time-Based Analysis:
  i.	The dashboard offers the ability to analyze sales data over different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and performance 
      fluctuations.
  ii.	Supports historical comparisons to track year-over-year growth and understand the impact of promotional campaigns.

5.	Real-time Data Refresh:
  i.	Integrated with the company’s sales databases, the dashboard updates in real-time, allowing the sales team to access up-to-the-minute information.
  ii.	Real-time updates ensure that managers and decision-makers can act quickly to address performance issues or capitalize on emerging opportunities.

6.	User Interactivity:
  i.	Users can filter and drill down on specific data points, enabling them to focus on the information most relevant to their needs.
  ii.	Interactive slicers and buttons allow stakeholders to quickly adjust the view, enhancing the dashboard’s usability.

7.	Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Tracking:
  i.	KPIs like total revenue, sales growth, average transaction value, and sales per employee are clearly visualized.
  ii.	The dashboard allows managers to set targets and track progress in real-time.

# Implementation Process:
1.	Data Preparation: Raw sales data from multiple sources (regional databases, point-of-sale systems, customer databases) was gathered and cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2.	Relational Model Design: A relational data model was built, integrating different data sources into a unified schema to enable seamless analysis and reporting.
3.	DAX Calculations: Calculated fields were added using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate key metrics like sales growth, margin, and customer segmentation.
4.	Dashboard Creation: Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was created with various visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables, to represent data in a     clear and actionable format.
5.	Real-time Data Connection: The dashboard was connected to the sales database to ensure that data updates are reflected in real time.

# Results:
1.	The sales team at Maven Market now has a centralized platform to access comprehensive sales performance insights.
2.	The interactive features of the dashboard have significantly reduced the time spent on manual reporting, allowing teams to focus on strategy and performance optimization.
3. 	Managers and regional leaders can easily track KPIs, compare performance across regions, and take timely actions based on real-time data.
4.	By analyzing product-level and regional trends, Maven Market has been able to optimize stock levels, focus on high-performing products, and design targeted promotions for high-value 
    customers.

# Conclusion: 
This Power BI dashboard has empowered Maven Market's sales teams to make informed, data-driven decisions, leading to improved sales performance across regions and product categories. By providing actionable insights and enabling real-time monitoring, the dashboard plays a crucial role in enhancing operational efficiency and driving business growth.
